[Infinitus](http://www.endurancesociety.org/infinitus.html) comes in a few different flavors with a range of fixed distance and fixed time races. Everything from 8K to 888K and 48hr to 72hr. I've never really done a fixed time race so I'm going for the 48hr.

The format for the time based flavors is to complete as many laps around the ~26 mile figure 8 loop as you can in the amount of time you have. Home base is at the center of the figure 8 and is where you have the opportunity to rest up and resupply before continuing on.

I think the key to this race is to stay on the course and to keep moving for as long as possible. To me this means run when possible, walk when needed, and don't stay at the home base very long. This means physically, mentally, and nutritionally, everything needs to be in order.

## Building Volume

To be able to stay on the course as much as possible, my body needs to be able to withstand the punishment. This means volume and time on my feet.

My thoughts on building volume break down in to just 2 things: running and rucking. The idea of [rucking](http://www.goruck.com/rucking) as a core part of my training is a new idea for me, but it makes complete sense. Sure I've done plenty of rucking to prepare for GORUCK events, but it was always somewhat secondary. With Infinitus, I'm fairly certain the majority of my time with be spent power hiking, aka rucking.

To get volume you have to give volume. I figure I need to build up to 100 miles in a week (50 run / 50 ruck) to feel good about starting the race. To break that down I start at the end and work my way back. I need ~2 weeks to taper and let my body heal up to race fresh, so 5/16 is my end point. I will start with 10 run / 10 ruck and each week add 5 miles to each, my starting point is 3/15. Each week the `long run/ruck` should be half of the total and on back to back days. By the last week, I will be running and rucking all week then Fri I'll run 25 miles and Sat I'll ruck 25 miles.

## Maintenance

Building volume in this way is risky and could leave me injured as (at least initially) it far exceeds the generally excepted 10% rule; I've got to be diligent with my maintenance. This will mostly be from daily rolling and stretching and periodic yoga. The objective it to keep the muscles, tendons, and ligaments from getting tight and knotted

## Nutrition

Nutrition is hugely important, both while training and not training. The abuse that I'm going to put my body through while building volume could lead to lots of problems like inflammation, over training, and injury. Studies show that a plant-based whole foods diet not only reduces and prevents inflammation but also speeds up recovery and healing.

I'm already mostly plant-based, but I need to totally clean it up to get the most out of this training.

## The Sleep Issue

As I get in to the later parts of the training, the time requirement is going to be huge. To get in the required milage I'll need to do 2-a-days, running in the morning, rucking at night. Then there is the long run / ruck, the 25 mile ruck will take me ~7-8 hours. This will have to be done early in the morning or late at night eating into sleep cycles that are valuable for recovery. The up side is this is a also good training for the race...

One of the biggest race strategy questions I think about is how much I plan to sleep. While I think I could make it without sleeping at all, my experience tells me to never underestimate the impact of a power nap.

The longest I've hiked was ~22hrs on the AT through the night. For this I took 2 10min power naps. These naps pushed the reset button and I was good for at least 3 more hours of hiking. I imagine there is a factor of diminishing returns where eventually they do more harm then good in terms of time, but it is a good place to start.

To keep with the general goal of not staying at home base very long, my plan is to never sleep at home base. If I need to have a power nap, it is going to be on the side of the trail.
