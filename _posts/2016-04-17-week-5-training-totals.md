I missed the mark this week. Going in to the long run I was down ~3.75 miles. I tacked that on my long run, which helped my hit my number but it was pushing it a bit. My rucking goal was missed mostly because of a time issue. I'll probably have a time issue this coming up week too since I've got day trips both Saturday and Sunday.
