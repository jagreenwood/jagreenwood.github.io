My body hurts. The added ruck miles has started to put a lot of stress on me, especially my right foot. The only reason this has me worried is because I sprained it last year. I ended up having to bail on my 5 mile Thursday night ruck.

So instead of adding 5 miles for running and rucking, I'll deload a bit. This coming week I'll do 20/20 instead of the planned 30/30. This will put me at 40/40 by the end of the training period, but I think I'll still be good for total volume.
