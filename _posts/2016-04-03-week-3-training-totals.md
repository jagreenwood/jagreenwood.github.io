Back on track this week. It is starting to hard to find the time for the long run and ruck, which sucks since I still have a long way to go. I'll probably need to them to earlier in the morning.

Also, for the first time since I've gotten my Apple Watch, I got the full week of meeting 3 goals achievement.
